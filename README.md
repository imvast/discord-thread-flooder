+ Warning: this may lag ur pc if u have a shitty one lol, also, this was a quick project i did for fun so if you want me to update it in the future, star the repo & create an "issue" [here](https://github.com/imvast/discord-thread-flooder/issues/new/choose)
- Simple to use all you gotta do is `pip install` all the needed modules then `py mass.py`
- - Once you get it running do `[prefix]threadspam` in the channel you want to mass create threads in.
- - - Disclaimer: do not hold me for ur actions lolz
